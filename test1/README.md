# Test 1 - Web scraping with BeautifulSoup in Python

In this test we download a PDF file with web scraping using
[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

Install the dependencies with the following command.

```bash
$ pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Now run the [notebook](1.ipynb) or execute the [script](../scripts/test1/1.py).
The file is then downloaded to the current directory.
